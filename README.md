# SPLINES
In this repository, I have implemented a tool for creating, editing splines. The scripts give easy access to the points of the curve and the ability to get the point, tangent, normal and binormal at the desired point of the curve.

1) Bézier
2) B-spline
3) Cardinal

## Redactor
The editor allows you to see the curve, normals, tangents and binormals. You can change the location and reset the control points.

## Usage
You can see a simple example of how to use it in the Curve Animator file.
